# TransitDB
CPSC 304 course project

## Summary
Our database project models a public transit system and tries to capture necessary information about transit lines, vehicles, commuters and employees. It allows for administrative supervision, rider account and payments management, and real-time schedule information for client-side applications.

### Task Breakdown
* The front-end and back-end will be evenly distributed amongst all three of our group members to ensure we each get exposure to the different types of development and maximize our learning opportunities. 

## Timeline
### Step 1) Decide on which portion of the project to implement
Tentatively, we have chosen to represent these relations:
* Line [Jasvir]
* Line_Has_Station [Payam]
* Station [Payam]
* Station_Has_Amenities [Flora]
* Amenities [Flora]
* Bus [Jasvir]
* Train [Payam]
* Ferry [Flora]
* Timing [Flora]
* Vehicle_Operates_In_line [Jasvir]
* StationLine_Scheduled_for_Timing [Flora]

### Step 2) Go over TA feedback & make necessary changes to previous stages of the project [March 15-18]

### Step 3) Getting familiar with the frameworks we will be using (PHP/Oracle Database) [March 17-20]

### Step 4) Designing a prototype for GUI [March 18-19]

### Step 5) Begin with backend development [March 20-25]
* Storing the data in the back-end
* Writing the PHP code to control the functions of the application
* Testing the code and ensuring compatibility between our parts
* Ensuring integrity constraints

### Step 6) Front-end [March 26-April 1]
* Creating basic structure of the front-end
  * Creating a table and a button 
  * Creating text boxes
  * Determine how to place data inside a table
* Styling the structure
* Triggering the data to refresh once the button is clicked
* Creating a save option for user to store their data in the backend

### Step 7) Discuss and resolve merge conflicts [April 2-4]
* Implement, test, debug our own and each otherâ€™s code
* Integrate front-end and back-end

### Step 8) Run through demo as a group [April 4]
* Ensure implementation is functioning properly
* Make any last minute stylistic edits
