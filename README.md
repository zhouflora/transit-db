# TransitDB
CPSC 304 Course Project

## Project Description
Our database project models a public transit system and tries to capture necessary information about transit lines, vehicles, commuters and employees. It allows for administrative supervision, rider account and payments management, and real-time schedule information for client-side applications.

In our application, users may perform a multitude of operations from registering for a new UserAccount to keep track of their transit card details, obtaining information about different entities in our database, and more. Try it out!
