# TransitDB
CPSC 304 course project

## Summary
Our database project models a public transit system and tries to capture necessary information about transit lines, vehicles, commuters and employees. It allows for administrative supervision, rider account and payments management, and real-time schedule information for client-side applications.

### Task Breakdown
* The front-end and back-end will be evenly distributed amongst all three of our group members to ensure we each get exposure to the different types of development and maximize our learning opportunities.
